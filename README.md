- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @PaulaJosefine Schultheiss
- ðŸ‘€ I am a Ph.D. student at Columbia Univeristy in New York. 
- ðŸ¤  Working under the advisement of Dr. Lance Kam in his Lab for Microscale Biocomplexity, I am currently investigating how the process of T-cell activation is influenced by substrate rigidity, with a specific focus on the interplay between mechanosensing and cellular metabolism.
